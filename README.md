# employeeManager

employeeManager is an application that helps keep track of your staffing within the company. It allows the user to add departments, roles, and employees while also allowing the user to view the current database that had been created. The user may also update the performing roles of staff members as they move about the company.

## Future Development

Looking to include removal functions as well as being able to view employees, roles, and departments by salaries, managers, and/or other criterias.
